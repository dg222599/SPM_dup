Tool used for UI design - FIGMA

### Instructions for front-end team 

* There are two useful sub-directories under the "design" directory for frontend team. To promote parallel work, the designers will push pencil-skeches which will be skeleton of the respected components in "pencil-sketches" sub-directory so these can be used to start coding the basic skeleton / architecture. 
* Under 'sample_designs' directory, 'DESIGNS_FOR_REVIEW.md' file contains the Figma designs to review. Any issues related to that designs should be addressed as comments for that commit itself.
* After a day or two, those designs will be finalised if there aren't any changes and design team will pushed the png images for that design. 
* The final designs may vary from pencil sketches but not much otherwise will be the same.
